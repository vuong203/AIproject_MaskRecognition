 The subject of the use of artificial intelligence, in situations where it is impossible to clearly classify data, is enjoying increasing popularity nowadays. Artificial neural networks (ANN) are used in smartphones, autonomous cars, or translational tools. Thanks to their ability to lean, based on searching for similarities between objects and their generalization, they can deal with problems where a very accurate classification is required. The report presents an application for recognizing objects in image using machine learning algorithms, which task is to recognize objects visible in the image and assigning them the correct label. Particularly important here is the high ability to identify objects that were not previously included in the training set, which distinguished neural networks from other algorithms.
