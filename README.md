# Python Mask Detector 
The Project was used during the COVID-19 pandemic at Bach Khoa University, Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam. Help the school to protect the student from the COVID-19.


## Description

An application for recognizing objects in image using machine learning algorithms, which task is to recognize objects visible in the image and assigning them the correct label. Particularly important here is the high ability to identify objects that were not previously included in the training set, which distinguished neural networks from other algorithms.

### Dependencies

* Python 3
* TensorFlow
* Keras
* Imutils
* Numpy
* OpenCV-Python
* Matplotib
* Scipy

### Installing

We must install the requirements into our Windows Prompt. In this case, I used Anaconda Prompt. Anaconda is a Python distribution for scientific computing (data science, machine learning application, large scale data processing, predictive analytics), that aims to simplify package management and deployment.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Executing program

* Run the code : 
```
python3 detect_mask_video.py
```
